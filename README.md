This is my first project, where I have developed a website - more precisely, a Contact List app - where I can add new contacts, modify them, or delete them, just by the click of a few buttons. It is my 'first' in the sense, that I have developed this website using MEAN stack - all the websites I have developed earlier were done with HTML5/CSS3, JS, and PHP.

This project already contains some further modifications, but the main objective was to understand how to develop websites using MEAN stack.

If you guys want to know how I have developed this website, you can go to the following link:

If you have any questions/suggesstions, you can create an issue. You are also welcome to suggest more features/optimizations. You can also implement those features/optimizations yourself - but they shouldn't overwrite the existing features/settings.
